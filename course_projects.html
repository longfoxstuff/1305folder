<h3>Project 1</h3>
<p>You need to receive two numbers from the user.  Calculate the square of the first number and half the second number.  
Then print out the original two numbers, the square of the first number, and half the second number.  
Follow that up with a message thanking the user for using the program.</p>

<p>Email the completed project to your instructor, label it Project 1.
It should be Word document containing your IPO Table (using Word's tabling features), 
a flowchart (using Word's drawing tools or other tool or drawn by hand), and an algorithm for this problem.</p>

<p>Hint: Look at lesson 13 for an indication on what these should look like.</p>

<h3>Project 2</h3>
<p>Create an HTML document that uses JavaScript to do the following: You need to receive two numbers from the user.  
Calculate the square of the first number and half the second number.  
Then print out the original two numbers, the square of the first number, and half the second number.  
Follow that up with a message thanking the user for using the program.</p>
<p>You should use the Word document containing your IPO Table (using Word's tabling features), 
a flowchart (using Word's drawing tools or Insert Shape tool), and an algorithm that you created for Project 2. 
Email the completed project to your instructor. Label it project2.html.</p> 

<h3>Project 3</h3>
<p>Create an HTML document that uses JavaScript to do the following: You need to receive a temperature from the user.  
If the temperature is above 85 the program should display a message saying “It’s hot outside!” 
If the temperature is between 85 and 50 the program should display a message saying “It’s not hot outside!” 
If the temperature is below 50 the program should display a message saying “It’s cold outside!” Requires a button!
<p>You should include a Word document containing your IPO Table (using Word's tabling features), 
a flowchart (using Word's drawing tools or Insert Shape tool), and an algorithm for the Project and the project itself. 
Email the completed project to your instructor. Label it project3.html.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Final P:roject</h3>
<p>Develop a program to allow a teacher to enter an arbitrary number of grades, perform an average calculation and then display the result in a 
grammatical sentence. The program must also tell the user if no grades were entered. You are required to use a loop and an “if else” statement. 
Be sure to declare all variables and test for the possibility of division by zero.</p>
<p>You will be required to submit an IPO table, a flowchart, and an algorithm. Comments within your code are also required.</p>
