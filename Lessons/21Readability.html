		&nbsp;from the initial definition of the problem to the final test result.</strong></p> 
		<p><strong>&nbsp;Documentation involves both external documentation<br />
		&nbsp;&#40;such as hierarchy charts, the solution algorithm, and test data results&#41;<br />
		&nbsp;and internal documentation that may have been coded in the program.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>&nbsp;If a program has been well designed using structured programming techniques,<br />
		&nbsp;the code will be seen as self documenting, resulting in easier maintenance.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></p>
		<p><strong>&nbsp;Guidelines:</strong></p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Always have a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">header</span> including</li>
			<li style="margin-left:60px;">Assignment title/program title</li>
			<li style="margin-left:60px;">Date</li>
			<li style="margin-left:60px;">Your name</li>
			<li style="margin-left:60px;">Any other important info</li>
			
			<li>Use comments to point out major features in your program</li>
			<li>These usually will closely follow the Processes in your IPO table or 
				the steps in your algorithm or the blocks in your flowchart</li>
			
			<li>Use blank lines to break apart sections of code for better 
				readability</li>
			
			<li>Use descriptive variable names</li>
		  </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;Following these guidelines will make your programming and debugging chores<br />
		&nbsp;much less taxing.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;These are some notes from Mitchell C. Kerman and Ronald L. Brown in their book<br />
		&nbsp;&quot;Computer Programming Fundamentals with Applications in Visual Basic 6.0&quot;<br />
		&nbsp;Enjoy the reading!</p>

			Programming is the ultimate means of self-expression on a computer. Like an artist who 
			completes a beautiful painting, programmers often feel pride and accomplishment in their work. 
			Computer programming can also give feelings of great power; the computer dances at your command. 
			An artist&#39;s painting, however, is worthless unless other people have the opportunity to enjoy 
			it. Like the artist conveying thoughts through canvas, a programmer communicates ideas through source 
			code, Remember, a program is not only a means of informing the computer of your desires, but it also 
			communicates your ideas to other people. Programmers clarify and explain source code by using comments. 
			Just as a cookbook describes the details of a recipe with comments, you should add comments to your program.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:50px; font-family:Times; font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">
			Comments at the beginning of your source code should include the program title, program purpose or 
			description, programmer&#39;s name, program version number, date programmed, and date last modified. 
			Not every line of source code needs to be commented. In fact, comments should be used sparingly in your 
			source code. Remember, the idea is to make your source code self-commenting by using descriptive names 
			for objects, variables, constants, functions, and procedures. Comments should be placed at the beginning 
			of each function and procedure to describe its purpose, required parameters, and output. Furthermore, 
			it is better to place comments before a large block of code to describe what it does rather than comment 
			each line of the code.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:50px; font-family:Times; font-size:20px; text-align:justify;">
			The use of indented code and added white space &#40;blank lines&#41; can play a major role in 
			enhancing your program&#39;s readability. Indenting code within control structures by two or three 
			spaces is usually sufficient. The examples in this text use indentation and white space to enhance 
			readability. You should adopt a method of indentation and white space that is most comfortable for 
			you and best suited to your programming style.</p>

		&nbsp;&#40;Don&#39;t forget to DOCUMENT your programs nicely &#45; &#38; USE COMMENTS&#33;&#33;</strong>&#41;
	  
		<p>&nbsp;Problem 1</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">Write a program that allows the user to&#58;<br />
			Enter his or her first, middle, and last names on three separate lines.<br />
			The program then outputs the user&#39;s initials.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px";><code>finitial = fname.substr(0, 1)</code></p>
				
		<p>&nbsp;Problem 2</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">The Car Chase Problem&#58;<br /> 
			A speeding car is traveling at x miles per hour.<br > 
			A police car in pursuit of the speeder is traveling at y miles per hour, where y &#62; x.<br /> 
			If the police car is initially a distance d away from the speeder,<br /> 
			how long does it take the police car to catch the speeder,<br />
			and how far must the police car travel to do so?<br />
			Write a JavaScript program to solve this problem, where x, y, and d are user inputs.<br />
			Remember to account for both cases&#58;<br />
			The speeder can be traveling either toward or away from the police car.</p>
			
            <p>From Behind</p>			
			<p style="margin-left:40px";><code>var timeA = (distance/(speedP - speed1))<br />
			var distanceA = (speedP * timeA)</code></p>
			
			<p>From Ahead</p>
			<p style="margin-left:40px";><code>var timeA = (distance/(speedP + speed1))<br />
			var distanceA = (speedP * timeA)</code></p>

		<p>&nbsp;Problem 3</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">The speed of light, c, is approximately 3 x 10<sup>8</sup>
			meters per second.<br />
			Write a program that prompts the user to input time in seconds<br /> 
			and displays the distance that light travels in that time period.<br />
			Answer in complete sentences.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px";><code>3 x 10^8 = 300000000</code></p>	

		<p>&nbsp;Problem 4</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px;">Sam has a three-year auto loan at an 8.5&#37; annual interest rate.<br />
			His original loan was &#36;7920.<br />
			His monthly payment is &#36;250.<br />
			He has made payments on the loan for the past 18 months&#59;<br />
			he wants to know the payoff balance.<br />
			Write a program to determine the payoff balance of Sam&#39;s auto loan.<br />
			Prompt and answer in complete sentences.<br />
			The applicable formula appears below:</p>
				
		<p style="margin-left:60px; margin-right:40px;">
						
			<code>b = (ob * z) - p * ((z - 1)/i)</code><br />
			<br />

			b &#61; payoff balance<br />
			ob &#61; original balance<br />
			z &#61; Math.pow(1 + i, n - k)<br />
			p &#61; monthly payment<br />
			i &#61; monthly interest rate<br />
			k &#61; number of payments already made<br />
			n &#61; total number of monthly payments</code></p>
