      <p><b>QBasic can get data from several sources</b> including the user and 
      external files.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the program will use static data 
      inside the program itself.&nbsp; This might be a string of notes to play a 
      tune.&nbsp; It might be color sequences.&nbsp; It could be pretty much 
      anything the programmer wants to store &quot;permanently.&quot;&nbsp; (I say 
      permanently because the program actually has to be modified to change the 
      data if it's stored this way.)<p><b>Storing data in the program</b> is 
      done using DATA statements.&nbsp; These are usually at or near the end of 
      the program.&nbsp; The data is accessed by using the READ command which 
      assigns the values to variables during the execution of a program.<p>David 
      I. Schneider's &quot;<a href="http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/1,4096,0139738762.html,00.html">QBASIC 
      with an Introduction to Visual Basic 5.0</a>&quot; on page 59, has a good 
      discussion of this topic.<blockquote>
        <p><font face="Courier New">DATA statements store values to be assigned 
        to variables by READ statements during the execution of a program.&nbsp; 
        If a DATA statement contains more than one item of data, the items are 
        separated by commas.&nbsp; Examples of DATA statements are</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Courier New">DATA &quot;Mike Jones&quot;, 7.35, 35</font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier New">DATA &quot;John Smith&quot;, 6.75, 33</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Courier New">These six items of data could have been 
        placed in one DATA statement or in six different DATA statements.&nbsp; 
        The items of data will be assigned to variables one at a time in the 
        order they appear in the DATA statements.&nbsp; That is, &quot;Mike Jones&quot; 
        will be the first value assigned to a variable.&nbsp; After all the 
        items from the first DATA statement have been assigned to variables, 
        subsequent requests for values will be read from the next DATA 
        statement.&nbsp; Although DATA statements can appear anywhere in a 
        program, they are usually placed at the end, just before the END 
        statement.&nbsp; This makes them easy to find and modify.&nbsp; If <i>
        var</i> is a variable, then the statement</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Courier New">READ <i>var</i></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font face="Courier New">causes the program to look in the DATA 
        statements for the next available item of data and assign it to the 
        variable <i>var.</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This is an example of a program which reads and prints some info from 
      DATA statements.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>REM plong<br>

        REM 6-5-2005<br>
        <br>
        DIM username AS STRING, score AS SINGLE, age AS INTEGER<br>
        <br>
        CLS<br>
        <br>
        REM This is a header<br>
        PRINT &quot;User&quot;, &quot; Score&quot;, &quot; Age&quot;<br>
        <br>
        READ username, score, age<br>
        PRINT username, score, age<br>
        <br>
        READ username<br>
        READ score<br>
        READ age<br>
        PRINT username, score, age<br>
        <br>
        DATA &quot;Mike Jones&quot;, 7.35, 35<br>
        DATA &quot;John Smith&quot;, 6.75, 33<br>
        <br>
        END</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Notice that this contains several READ statements.&nbsp; It could have 
      been done with a minimum of two READS, but the latter set is for example.</p>
      <p>A problem like this is easily solved without a loop, but it would 
      become cumbersome if there were several thousand, or even a hundred sets 
      of data.&nbsp; A loop will make this program much improved.</p>
      <p>Since we know how much data is in the program we can use a for next 
      loop.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>This will be much more manageable.&nbsp; Play with it to see what 
      happens if you try to read more data than is available.</p>
      <p>If we had an undetermined amount of data we wouldn't want to use a 
      For-Next loop.&nbsp; A better choice would be the Do-While or the 
      Do-Until.</p>

      <p>Notice that the Do loop requires a bit of pre-loop-processing.&nbsp; It 
      also requires a <b>trailer value</b> or <b>sentinel</b>.&nbsp; This value 
      must be something which absolutely would not possibly be part of the data.&nbsp; 
      In this case I've used &quot;EOD&quot; for the string sentinel and -1 for the 
      numeric sentinel.&nbsp; This is necessary to inform the loop to stop.</p>
      <p>The RESTORE command is another important part of processing DATA, but 
      this will be left for another time.<br>
